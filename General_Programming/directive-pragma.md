## Directive pragma

In computer programming, a directive pragma (from "pragmatic") is a language construct that specifies how a compiler (or other translator) should process its input. 

ECMAScript also adopts the `use` syntax for directives, with the difference that pragmas are declared as string literals (e.g. "use strict";, or "use asm";), rather than a function call.
